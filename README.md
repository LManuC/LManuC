# Hello there!

This is my personal repo where I'll be uploading all my projects to show you.

#Solidapp

Nowadays I'm working with a 3D Printer manager for schedulling *.gcode file around all over the farm,
projects, stocks, clients, printers working, broken or waiting to start a new job. 

The first part is a Desktop app in Python and later an Android app in Kotlin.

Once I get the first approach to the Desktop app I'll be working on connect the printers to a VPN to 
report their working progress, start new jobs and, in a future, watch the job in progress and stop it
if there's any printing defect
